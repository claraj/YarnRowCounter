# YarnRowCounter

A basic Android app to count things, like rows knitted in a knitting project.  The same logic might be used to count the number of runners who have finished a race, or number of pallets unloaded from a truck, or any other time that a quantity of things need to be counted. 

Unfortunately it has a bug or two, and the user interface needs to be modified. You'll work on these tasks as a team.
